# Example App with Meteor, React, and Flux

This is a simple example button counter app that demonstrates Meteor implementation of React with a Flux dispatcher, [as implemented by Louis Herranz](https://github.com/meteorflux/dispatcher).

This example demonstrates a method using Meteor's global session variables as well as the more controllable Meteor Reactive Variables.
