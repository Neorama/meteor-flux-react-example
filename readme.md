# Example App with Meteor, React, and Flux

This is a simple example button counter app that demonstrates Meteor implementation of React with a Flux dispatcher, [as implemented by Louis Herranz](https://github.com/meteorflux/dispatcher).

This example demonstrates a method using Meteor's global [Session Variables](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/session) as well as Meteor [Reactive Variables](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/reactivevar_pkg).
